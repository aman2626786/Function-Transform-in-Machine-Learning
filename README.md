# Function-Transform-in-Machine-Learning
The notebook explores the Function Transformer in scikit-learn, along with other essential Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
# Key Topics and Concepts

# Function Transformer:
<br>What It Is: A versatile tool in scikit-learn that applies user-defined transformations to datasets.
<br>Why Itâ€™s Useful: Enables custom mathematical transformations not directly supported by built-in preprocessing functions in scikit-learn.

# Supporting Libraries:
<br>Pandas: For manipulating and analyzing datasets.
<br>NumPy: For handling arrays, matrices, and numerical operations.
<br>SciPy (stats): For statistical methods like hypothesis testing and probability distributions.
<br>Matplotlib: For creating visualizations such as plots and charts.
<br>Seaborn: For advanced statistical data visualization.
